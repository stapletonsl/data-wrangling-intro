# Data Wrangling using OpenRefine for Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS)

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction and setup 

- *Teaching:* Approximately 10 minutes.
- *Activities:* 5-10 minutes, depending on download speed of data and learners' skills.

## Overview of workshop

To introduce data cleaning concepts and the use of the [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) software to clean and standardise data.

### Background

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) is a [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)-based program that runs on your computer (not online).

It runs inside your Web browser, but no web connection is needed to use it, unless you want to bring in Web-based data for cleaning. Once data has been read into OpenRefine, however, no further connection is needed work with it.

### Features of OpenRefine

- Open source collaboratively developed software ([OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) source code is housed on [GitHub](https://https://github.com/)
- A growing community of users worldwide, from novice to expert, ready to help.
- Works with large datasets, i.e. those greater than 100,000 rows.
- Can adjust memory allocation to accommodate larger datasets.

### Things you can use OpenRefine for

- Identifying where data is missing
- Identifying and fixing inconsistencies in data
- Splitting columns or rows of data up into more granular parts
- Merging columns or rows of data
- Combining multiple datasets into one
- Repeating the same step many times with different data
- Opening a dataset that is too large for Excel
- Tracking changes made to data
- Changing case within a column
- Exporting the steps as a reusable script

### Getting the software for the lesson

Installing OpenRefine on your own Windows computer may require two things:

- A JAVA install
- Moving the OpenRefine program folder to `C:\program files`. You will need administrator privileges to do that in some cases.

**Windows**

- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browsers installed and set as your default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser. It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.

- Download the latest software version from [http://openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org). 

- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory by right-clicking and selecting `Extract ...`. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.

- Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.

- Move the folder to  `C:\program files`.

- Launch OpenRefine by clicking the `openrefine.exe` file (this will launch a command prompt window, but you can ignore that and wait for the browser to launch)

- If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ or http://localhost:3333 to launch the program.

### Troubleshooting

You may also need to install Java for Windows

- Check if your Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit help via: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/15056/windows-32-64-bit-faq](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/15056/windows-32-64-bit-faq).

- Select appropriate bit download
  - 32-bit via: https://www.java.com/en/download/ 
  - 64-bit  via:  https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp  and
    Select Windows Offline (64-bit) version

- Choose the folder location. Save the file to `c:\program files\`

- Close all applications including the browser.

- Double-click on the saved file icon to start the installation process.

**Mac**
- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browsers installed and set as your default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser. It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
- Download latest software version from [http://openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org)
- Drag icon into `Applications folder`
- Doubleclick to launch OpenRefine
- If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at
  http://127.0.0.1:3333/ or http://localhost:3333 to launch the program.
  
### Troubleshooting
- If OpenRefine doesn’t open due to security settings go to:
  - `System Preferences> security & privacy >` see message re: OpenRefine
  - select Open anyway

**Linux**
- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browsers installed and set as your default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser. It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
- Download the latest software version from [http://openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org). 
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.
- Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.
- Launch OpenRefine
-Type `./refine` into the terminal within the OpenRefine directory
- If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ or http://localhost:3333 to launch the program.

### Getting the data for the lesson

Download the `QLDtrafficAccidentsOpenDataVer1.csv` dataset from this [website](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/owncloud/index.php/s/NphyCS2OvSIZe8E)
to your `Downloads` folder. We will then import that data into OpenRefine.

Alternately, when you launch OpenRefine, you can import the data directly from a Web address using this link [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stapletonsl/ClassData2020/master/QLDtrafficAccidentsOpenDataVer1.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stapletonsl/ClassData2020/master/QLDtrafficAccidentsOpenDataVer1.csv)

### Getting help

**Online**

You can find out more at the [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) website and check out some great introductory videos. These videos and others on OpenRefine can also be found on YouTube - use the search term 'OpenRefine'.

There is a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine) that can answer a lot of beginner questions and problems.

**At Griffith University**

Help is available at Griffith [Hacky Hour](https://hackyhourgriffith.wordpress.com/) sessions, Thursdays between 2-3pm alternating weeks at Gold Coast and Nathan campuses.  Grab a free coffee and we can help you.
